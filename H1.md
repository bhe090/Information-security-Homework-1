In this real case story the scammer plays vary smartly by calling a fake call with the help of AI to copy the voice of someone else. He ask for monney by showing he is in abroad and had some irrelated claim and he need urgent money fronm his cousin. But in Reality this scammer had stolen his cousins information and copied and pretend to be like him and his cousin send him the money. Ater few days later when he knows the truth by talking to his sister he was completely shocked after knowing it was a scam and his real cousin didnt had any help he was perfectly alright.these things are increasing in punjab day by day.

My thaughts in this matter is just send any money or believing in any thing afterv knowing deeply and with proper inspection because now a days lots of scams are happening so we all need to be aware with it and also before taking any steps must consult with family.
